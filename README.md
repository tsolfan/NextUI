- Game switcher menu (Onion OS style) by [@frysee](https://github.com/frysee)
- High audio quality, due to advanced resampling engine using [libsamplerate](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate) (with quality/performance setting per emulator)
- Much lower latency (average 20ms, 1 frame of 60fps)
- Shaders!
- Fully OpenGL/GPU based for faster performance!
- native WiFi support
- Game art/media support
- Game time tracker!
- Cheats support
- Integrated WiFi
- Bluetooth Audio
- Overlays support!
- Dynamic cpu speed scaling (keeps your device cool and extends battery life, but gives the performance right when needed)
- Fully GPU OpenGL based for faster performance
- Custom bootlogos contributed by [@SolvalouArt](https://bsky.app/profile/solvalouart.bsky.social)
- Color and font settings to customize the NextUI interface
- Menu animations

- Haptic feedback in the menu by [@ExonakiDev](https://github.com/exonakidev)
- Ambient LED mode, the LEDS act like Ambient light TV's for extra immersion, configurable per emulator
- Display controls (color temperature, brightness, contrast, saturation, exposure)
- Support for automatic NTP time synchronization with timezones and realtime clock (RTC)
- Deep Sleep mode, gives instant ON and avoids the overheat bug on the Brick by [@zhaofengli](https://github.com/zhaofengli)

---

## How to use

While in menu:

- Hold `start` and press `volume up` or `volume down` to adjust brighness
- Hold `select` and press `volume up` or `volume down` to adjust color temperature
- Short press `select` to open the game switcher

While in game:

- `Menu` opens in game options menu, adjusting controls, scaling and what not
- Hold `menu` and `select` at same time to open up the game switcher

Deep sleep:

When the device is left idle it will enter light sleep. Light sleep turns the screen off and pulses the leds 5 times.

After two minutes the device will go into deep sleep. The leds will turn completely off.

## What about X feature?

NextUI supports a variety of optional extras called Paks that are maintained by community members.

Our wiki has a [list of all available Paks](https://nextui.loveretro.games/pak-store/) that can be downloaded from our Pak Store straight on your device.
